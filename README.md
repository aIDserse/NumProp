## NumProp
A flowchart diagram that extracts the properties of the entered numbers<br>
It calculates if the number is even or odd, prime or not and the prime number factorization.<br>
On my site there is a photo of the algorythm and an explaination of it

The .rap file has to be opened with the raptor flowchart interpreter<br>
On the releases you can find the .exe file<br>
With the interpreter you can convert the .rap in several languages<br>
